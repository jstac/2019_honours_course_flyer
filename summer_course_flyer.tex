\noindent 
This one week summer course for advanced undergraduate students and policy
professionals will provide training in cutting edge computational modeling for
economic analysis.  Intake is highly selective and all university students
accepted to the program will be fully funded.  The course will also provide a
forum for students to interact with policy professionals from the Treasury,
the Productivity Commission and the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The motivation for this short course is that computationally intensive models
are increasingly used for applied policy analysis and, as a result, economic
modeling now requires strong computational skills.  For example, many
computational models in economics are built on top of an optimal choice
framework called dynamic programming (see, e.g., \citet{LS18} and \citet{SLP89}), which is used in contexts such as fiscal
and monetary policy, as well as analyses of industry-specific policy including
water in the Murray-Darling Basin \citep{Grafton2011} and energy demand and
supply \citep{Ringkjob2018}.  State-of-the-art dynamic programming is
computationally intensive and intellectually demanding.

This one-week intensive course will establish a baseline competency in
those computational methods required to apply dynamic programming and other
related techniques for the purpose of public
policy analysis. The skills gained will be
directly useful for public policy practitioners. For students, the course will
provide a basis for further study and research, a chance to meet and discuss
in-demand skills with policy professionals, and a demonstrable
applied skill for prospective job applications. It will build the
pool of talent available to public policy institutions requiring computational
economic modeling.



\subsection*{Goals}

The goal of this course is to 
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item develop capacity in computational modelling for the analysis of Australian economic data,
    \item grow interest in computational economics in order to encourage students to
        undertake further research and learning in the area, and 
    \item build bridges between academic economists, students and Australia's
        leading policy institutions.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection*{Instructors}

The primary instructor is John Stachurski.  Guest lecturers will include
Dr.\ Fedor Iskhakov (ANU) and policy professionals (TBA).


\subsection*{Structure}

The structure of the course for its one week duration will be as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 9am-12pm: Lectures
    \item 1pm-5pm: Group exercises 
\end{itemize}

There will also be a social event sponsored by the Research School of
Economics, as well as presentations from representatives of leading policy
institutions on economic modeling in practice.


\subsection*{Course Content}

The coding language of instruction will be Python, which is rapidly rising
in popularity for scientific computing, artificial intelligence and machine
learning.  The course will cover the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python and its scientific libraries
    \item Dynamic models and distributions
    \item Dynamic programming and optimization
    \item Basic principles of software engineering
    \item Introduction to high performance computing
\end{itemize}

Applications will be drawn from macroeconomics, finance and applied
microeconomics.

\subsection*{Financial Support}

Accommodation and travel costs will be covered for all honours students based 
outside Canberra.  Tuition will be covered for all honours students.

\subsection*{Prerequisite Knowledge}

Attendees will require familiarity with calculus and linear algebra.
All attendees should have a strong interest in computing.

\subsection*{Applications}

To apply, honours students should write a discussion of up to one page on
their interests in economics and computational methods, their future plans,
and why they
believe they would benefit from the course.    Students should also attach an
academic transcript to their application email.  Applications should be sent
to both \href{mailto:john.stachurski@anu.edu.au}{john.stachurski@anu.edu.au} and
\href{mailto:sebastian.wende@anu.edu.au}{sebastian.wende@anu.edu.au}, with the
subject line ``Honours Summer Course Application''.

\textbf{Applications close midnight Sunday 29 September.}

\subsection*{Administration}
