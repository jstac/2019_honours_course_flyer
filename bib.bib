  title = {A review of modelling tools for energy and electricity systems with
	large shares of variable renewables},
  journal = {Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews},
  year = {2018},
  volume = {96},
  pages = {440-459},
  number = {C},
  abstract = {This paper presents a thorough review of 75 modelling tools currently
	used for analysing energy and electricity systems. Increased activity
	within model development in recent years has led to several new models
	and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better
	represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of
	this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available
	modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers
	in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model.
	A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power
	system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been
	assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal
	resolution as well as the technological and economic features of
	the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information
	has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated
	contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date.
	With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's
	electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing
	share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the
	energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent
	short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect
	of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling
	studies.},
